Description:A simple API to add/update/delete/fetch cars from a DB. The DB used here is sqlite3. Cars are identified by their make, model and VIN number (although the model has an autogenerated id field and an autogenerated datetime field which is initialized to time of model creation)
See the Doxygen generated HTML file for the carsview module for the relative URLs for the CRUD ops.
To run this, you will need the Django REST framework(github URL https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework), in addition to Django 1.5.
To run the unit tests in the test folder, you will also need the requests API (github URL https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
